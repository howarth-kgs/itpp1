Project Details:

    If you haven’t already created an HTML file to contain your notes from this section, 
    refer back to the beginning of the lessons for setting up your file.
    To complete this project, you’ll need to submit your notes as an HTML file 
    using the tags you learned about in these lessons, such as <p>,<div>, <h1>, <b>, <em>, and <span>.
    Keep it simple. 
    CSS is used for styling and is not necessary for this project.
    Make sure you use proper HTML Document structure for your code.
